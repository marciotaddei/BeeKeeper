BeeKeeper app for Android is a simple, educational-purpose project. The app solves (a.k.a. cheats on) the NYTimes Spelling Bee. More specifically, it fetches today's problem and then solves it automatically based on non-official dictionaries. Nice to check your personal solutions, or to avoid being stuck. A custom instance of a spelling-bee problem can also be manually input, with varying amount of letters. Five dictionary options are available, all in accordance with past, recorded Spelling Bee official solutions.

No warranty applies, the app will be eventually available on F-Droid (because Google Play Store has a US$25 entry barrier). I don't expect anyone to download it beside my own friends.
